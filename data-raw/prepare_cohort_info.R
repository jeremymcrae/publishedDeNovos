# construct R package data frame of sex-specific numbers of affected probands
# reported on in published exome sequencing of children with developmental
# disorders (autism, congenital heart disease, intellectual disability,
# epilepsy, and schizophrenia).
#
# This provides the total population of trio-based probands investigated within
# these studies, that is, the population for whom a de novo mutation might have
# been identified. This determines the number of mutations we expect to find
# within the total population.
#
# The table of sex-counts has been carefully extracted from the publications,
# accounting for overlap in samples between different publications.
